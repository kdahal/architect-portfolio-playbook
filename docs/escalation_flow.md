# Escalation Flow (playbook)

1. Customer files ticket -> Applied Eng triages and creates reproducible case.
2. If not resolvable within SLA window, notify SRE and Product.
3. Perform root cause analysis, propose fix or workaround.
4. Communicate timeline to customer and update ticket.
5. Postmortem + changes to runbook + automation if recurring.
